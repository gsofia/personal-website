		<h1> About Me </h1>

		<img src="images/sofiaPhoto.png" alt="Photograph of Sofia" id="sofia-Photo"/>

			<p> I graduated from the University of Michigan School of Information where I earned a Master's Degree in Information Science with a specialization in Human Computer Interaction. I am most interested in how people collect and analyze information when making decisions and how to organize online content to be intuitive to users. </p>

			<p> Before attending graduate school I worked as an Associate Information Architect for the brand management firm Siegel+Gale where I simplified financial documents to make them more user friendly. Prior to my work at Siegel+Gale I worked as an editor for the art-book publishing company Abrams. I have a Bachelor of Arts in psychology with a minor in digital media from Carnegie Mellon University. </p>
